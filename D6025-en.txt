Here's a summary of the Mini Hydraulic Power Pack Type A specification, focusing on key features and considerations for decision-making:

**Summary: Mini Hydraulic Power Pack Type A**

The Mini Hydraulic Power Pack Type A is a compact unit designed to supply hydraulic oil in various hydraulic systems. It features a modular design with an external gear pump flange-mounted to the equipment rack and a round plastic oil tank with an M14x1.5 filling screw.

**Key Features:**

*   **Compact Design:** Motor shaft also serves as the pump shaft for space efficiency.
*   **Modular Construction:** Allows for flexible configuration with different motors, pumps, and tank sizes.  Type A 100 has Q and H equipment racks. Can be used with Type-TLC and SL valve banks in the modular system
*   **Power Supply:** Available in both DC and AC power configurations.
*   **Operating Pressure:** Maximum operating pressure up to 210 bar (A 080, A 100 models), A 065 models have a max operating pressure of 150 bar.
*   **Tank Volume:** Effective tank volume ranges from 0.2 to 0.8 liters, with fill volumes varying depending on the tank size chosen. Usable tank volume varies from 0.23 to 1.2l, depending on the configuration.
*   **Flow Rate:** Maximum flow rate up to 3 l/min.
*   **Installation:** Suitable for both vertical (tank on top) and horizontal installation (A 080, A 100 models). A 065 should be installed vertically.
*   **Noise Level:** Relatively quiet operation (55-60 dB(A) depending on the motor).
*   **Fluid Compatibility:** Designed for hydraulic fluids according to DIN 51 524 Parts 1 to 3; ISO VG 10 to 68 according to DIN ISO 3448.
*   **Temperature Range:**
    *   A 065: Environment: approx. -15 to +80째C, hydraulic fluid: -10 to +40째C
    *   A 080, A 100: Environment: approx. -30 to +80째C, hydraulic fluid: -15 to +80째C
*   **Pumps:** Miniature external gear pump with varying displacement volumes.
*   **Motors:** Various DC and single-phase AC motor options with different power ratings, voltages, and duty cycles.  Thermal switches included on some DC motors.  The direction of the motor shaft is left, when looking at the shaft.
*   **Weight:** Weight varies from 1.8 kg to 6 kg depending on the motor and configuration, without hydraulic fluid.
*   **Service Life:** 10 years with max. 10,000 cycles
*   **Available versions:** Lifting version (H) and one flow direction (Q)

**Decision-Making Considerations:**

*   **Application Requirements:** Is it suitable for short period operation? What are the pressure and flow requirements of your application? Is it floor-lock systems, automotive technology, aviation, decentralised hydraulic controls?
*   **Power Source:** Do you require DC or AC power? What voltage is needed?
*   **Space Constraints:** The compact design is advantageous, but ensure the dimensions (provided in the document) fit your available space.
*   **Fluid Compatibility:** Confirm the chosen hydraulic fluid is compatible with the system and operating temperatures.
*   **Duty Cycle:** Check the duty cycle ratings of the motor options to ensure they meet your application's demands.
*   **Installation Orientation:** The A 065 model must be installed vertically. The A 080 and A 100 models can be installed both horizontally and vertically.
*   **Additional Options:** Consider the need for throttles or lowering valves, which are available for the lifting version (H).
