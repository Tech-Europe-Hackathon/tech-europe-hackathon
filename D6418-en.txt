*   **Weight:** PC06: 1.7 kg (POH), 2.5 kg (PIH); PC10: 6.7 kg (PIH).
*   **Advantages:** High flexibility with various circuit symbols, direct and proportional control, good resolution, and low hysteresis (with displacement transducer).
*   **Installation:** Any position possible, horizontal preferred.
* **Accessories:** A variety of line connectors and seal kits.
* **Amplifier:** Recommended digital amplifier type EV2D according to D 7821.

**To Determine Suitability:**

*   **Application Requirements:** If precise control and feedback are crucial, choose the PIH model with the displacement transducer.
*   **Flow Rate:** Select the appropriate size (PC06 or PC10) and flow rate coding based on the actuator's flow requirements.
*   **Pressure:** Ensure the operating pressure of your system is within the valve's specifications.
*   **Fluid Compatibility:** Confirm that the hydraulic fluid used is compatible with the valve's seals and temperature limits.
*   **Electrical System:** Verify that the valve's voltage requirements (12V DC) are compatible with your control system and make sure to use a compatible amplifier.
