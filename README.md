## Running the Backend

To start the backend, you need to run both `emailPolling.py` and `gemini2.py`.

1. **Run `emailPolling.py`** (Handles email polling)
   ```sh
   python emailPolling.py
   ```

2. **Run `gemini2.py`** (Main backend logic)
   ```sh
   python gemini2.py
   ```

Both scripts should be running simultaneously for the backend to function correctly.
