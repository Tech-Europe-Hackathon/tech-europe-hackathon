Here's a summary of the HAWE Hydraulik directional spool valve type CWPN, focusing on key features for decision-making:

**Summary: Directional Spool Valve Type CWPN**

The HAWE Hydraulik CWPN is a directly actuated, binary operated, manifold mounting directional spool valve (NG6/CETOP 03). It controls the direction and velocity of hydraulic consumers in hydraulic systems. It is suitable for machine tools, wind turbines, solar power plants and industrial hydraulics.

**Key Features:**

*   **Function:** 4/3-way or 4/2-way directional control of hydraulic actuators.
*   **Mounting:** Manifold mounting with standard NG 6 (CETOP 03) connection pattern, compatible with HAWE valve banks and compact power packs, as well as customer-specific manifolds.
*   **Pressure:** Maximum operating pressure of 350 bar (ports P, A, B). Return pressure is <=210 bar (port T) or <= 50 bar for HA/HB actuation.
*   **Flow Rate:** Maximum flow rate of 60 l/min (actual switchable flow may be lower depending on pressure – see characteristic lines in the document).
*   **Actuation Options:**
    *   **Electrical:** With or without manual override, soft-shift function (to avoid switching shocks).
    *   **Manual:** Optional manual actuation on A-side (HA) or B-side (HB).
*   **Circuit Symbols:** A variety of circuit symbols are available (G, GW, D, GB, H, HW, L, HB, X, W, C, B, E, R, O, V, K) to suit different applications.
*   **Additional Valves in Port P:** Options for including an orifice (0.8 - 2.0 mm) or a check valve in the pump port (P).
*   **Solenoid Voltage Options:** 12V DC, 24V DC, 98V DC, 205V DC, 110V AC, 230V AC with various electrical connectors (EN 175 301-803 A, AMP Junior Timer, Deutsch (DT 04-2P)) and IP ratings (IP65, IP67, IP69k).
*   **Hydraulic Fluid:** Compatible with hydraulic fluids according to DIN 51524 Parts 1 to 3; ISO VG 10 to 68 according to DIN ISO 3448. Suitable for biologically degradable hydraulic fluids type HEPG (polyalkylene glycol) and HEES (synthetic ester) at operating temperatures up to approx. +70°C. *Not* suitable for HETG such as rapeseed oil and water-glycol solutions, e.g. HFA and HFC. Cleanliness level ISO 4406 20/17/14.
*   **Operating Temperature:** Environment: -40 to +80°C, Hydraulic fluid: -25 to +80°C.
*   **Weight:** Depending on the circuit symbol and actuation options, approximately 1.8 kg - 2.6kg.
*   **Maintenance:** Regular checks of hydraulic connections for damage and cleaning of the device surface are recommended.

To determine suitability, carefully consider:

*   The required circuit symbol for your application.
*   The necessary actuation type (electrical, manual, or both).
*   The required solenoid voltage and connector type.
*   Whether an orifice or check valve is needed in port P.
*   Ensure the operating pressure and flow rate requirements are within the valve's specifications.
*   Hydraulic fluid compatibility.
