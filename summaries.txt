**Product Overview:**

The HAWE Radial Piston Pump Type R and RG are versatile, valve-controlled pumps designed for use in oil-hydraulic systems, either as standalone motor pumps or integrated within hydraulic power packs.  They provide lubricating hydraulic fluids and generate counter-pressure for hydraulic consumers.

**Key Features:**

*   **High Pressure Capability:**  Maximum operating pressure up to **700 bar**.
*   **Variable Flow Rates:**  Maximum displacement volume up to **64.18 cm3/rev**, and maximum flow rate up to **91.2 l/min**. Many flow rate options are possible via different configurations.
*   **Versatile Applications:** Suitable for high-pressure applications needing constant flow, including press construction, fixture design, testing/laboratory equipment, lubrication systems, and agricultural engineering.
*   **Design:** Radial piston design with cylinders arranged radially, driven by eccentrically fitted bearings on the drive shaft. An uneven number of pistons are used per cylinder radial, in order to minimize the pulsation of the ow rate.
*   **Multiple Assemblies:** Different assemblies (7631, 6010, 6011, 6012, 6014, 6016) offer varying configurations of cylinders, flow rates, and pressure capabilities.
*   **Two Main Types (R and RG):**
    *   **Type R:** Uses roller bearings for eccentric bearings and is suited for lower rotation speeds.
    *   **Type RG:** Uses plain bearings, providing longer service life in extreme conditions and with media with low lubricity (e.g., HFC).  Not suitable for low rotation speeds.
*   **Fluid Compatibility:** Designed for hydraulic fluids conforming to DIN 51524 Parts 1-3 (ISO VG 10-68). Also compatible with biologically degradable fluids (HEPG, HEES) and water-based fluids (with specific RG-HFA versions).
*   **Versions:** Offered in standard series and mounting for charged pumps versions, and hollow shaft versions.
*   **Seals:** Available with NBR (standard), FKM (VITON), or EPDM seals.
*   **Optional Features:**  Explosion-proof versions (EX) and hard coat housing (HC) are available.
*   **Installation:**  Can be mounted in any orientation between horizontal and vertical. Uses pipe thread ISO 228-1 connections.
*   **Rotation:** The pumps may rotate in any direction.
*   **Operating Temperatures:** Can operate within an environmental temperature range of approximately -40 to +80 °C, and with a hydraulic fluid temperature range of -25 to +80 °C.
*   **Filtration:** Requires a cleanliness level as per ISO 4406 (refer to oil recommendation D 5488/1 for specific details).

**Decision-Making Considerations:**

*   **Pressure and Flow Requirements:**  Select an assembly and configuration (number of cylinders, piston diameter) based on the required operating pressure and flow rate for the application.
*   **Operating Conditions:**
    *   **Speed:** Type R is better suited for low speeds; RG is better for high speeds and demanding applications. The optimum is around 1450 min-1.
    *   **Fluid Type:** RG-HFA is needed for water-based fluids.
    *   **Load Duration:**  Consider using a larger pump with a smaller piston diameter if load duration is high to preserve bearing life.
*   **Environmental Factors:** Consider temperature ranges, potential for explosive environments, and the need for specialized housing coatings.
*   **Maintenance:** Regular inspections and fluid cleanliness are crucial for long-term performance.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Installation:** Should be performed by trained personnel, ensuring cleanliness. Avoid installation above the tank.
*   **Hydraulic Fluid:** Use appropriate fluid, maintain cleanliness, and avoid mixing different fluid types. Filtration is crucial.
*   **Suction Pressure:** Absolute suction pressure must not fall below 0.85 bar.
*   **Pressure Relief:** A system pressure-limiting valve is required to prevent exceeding the maximum system pressure.
*   **Maintenance:** Primarily maintenance-free, but requires regular visual inspections for leaks and cleaning.

**To Decide if This Pump is Right for You:**

1.  **Determine Your Required Flow Rate:** Calculate the necessary flow rate based on the speed and cylinder/motor requirements of your hydraulic system. Choose a pump displacement volume that provides the desired flow at your operating RPM.
2.  **Check Pressure Requirements:** Ensure the 400 bar nominal pressure meets or exceeds your system's maximum pressure demands.
3.  **Consider Installation Space:** Review the pump dimensions to confirm it fits within your vehicle's available space.
4.  **Select Accessories:** Based on your specific application, determine if you need suction intakes or bypass valves.
5.  **Verify Shaft/Flange Compatibility:** Choose a shaft and flange option that matches your power take-off or drive mechanism.

Summary: Here's a summary of the HAWE Hydraulik C40V variable displacement axial piston pump, designed to help you decide if it fits your needs:

**Core Function:** This pump adjusts its geometric output volume from maximum to zero, thus varying the flow rate supplied to connected hydraulic consumers. It's intended for open-circuit hydraulic systems in mobile applications.

**Key Features & Benefits:**

*   **Variable Displacement:** Adapts flow rate to demand, improving efficiency.
*   **Swash Plate Principle:** Operates on this proven design for reliable performance.
*   **Pressure:** Nominal pressure of 280 bar, peak pressure of 320 bar.
*   **Displacement Volumes:** Available in 28.7, 46.5, 86.1, and 103.5 cm³/rev.
*   **Controller Options:** A broad range of controllers are available, including Load-Sensing (LS0DA, LS2DA, LS0DE, LS2DE), Pressure control (DF-DA, DE), Flow Control (VE), and Power Control (LR). These allow for tailored control strategies (e.g., constant pressure, constant flow, load-sensing). Electrically operated controllers are available.
*   **Thru-Shaft Compatibility:** Can be configured for thru-shaft applications, allowing for tandem pump arrangements.
*   **High Self-Suction Speed:** Facilitates reliable operation.
*   **Compact Design & Optimized Power-to-Weight Ratio:** Saves space and weight.
*   **Rotation Direction:** Clockwise or anti-clockwise options.
*   **Flange and shaft options**: Variety of options to connect to different equipment.

**Controller Types and what they do:**

*   **Load-Sensing (LS0DA/LS2DA/LS0DE/LS2DE):** Generate a variable, speed-independent flow rate. Adapt the displacement volume to the required flow rate and regulate a constant difference between load pressure and pump pressure. Some controllers also include pressure limitation and additional LS relief. LS0DE/LS2DE also have electro-proportional pressure control, which can be used to supply working functions and fan simultaneously.
*   **Pressure Control (DF-DA/DE):** Reduce swivel angle of pump and regulate a constant pressure level when the pump pressure exceeds set value. DE types use electrical signal for proportional adjustment of pressure.
*   **Flow Controller (VE):** Electro-proportional flow controller generating a variable flow rate depending on speed. Adjusts geometric displacement of the pump based on electrical input signal. Only available with rising characteristic line and in combination with pressure controller.
*   **Power Controller (LR):** Reduces the pump's swivel angle when the product of displacement volume times pressure exceeds a set value, protecting the drive shaft, motor, or gearbox from overloading. Only available in combination with a pressure- or load-sensing controller.

**Intended Applications:**

*   Forestry and Agricultural Machinery
*   Municipal Trucks
*   Construction Machines
*   Fan Control Systems
*   Lifting Platforms

**Important Considerations (Based on the Full Document):**

*   **Hydraulic Fluid:** Use appropriate fluid per DIN 51 524 (ISO VG 10 to 68). Maintain viscosity and temperature within specified ranges. Biologically degradable fluids are also suitable.
*   **Cleanliness:** Maintain hydraulic fluid cleanliness per ISO 4406 19/17/14 to prevent damage.
*   **Installation:** Mount with appropriate fittings, observing tightening torques. Consider suction line routing and drain line placement.
*   **Priming & Bleeding:** Fill the pump with hydraulic fluid and bleed it before initial use to prevent damage.
*   **Pressure Limiting Valve:** Install a system pressure-limiting valve in the pressure line to prevent exceeding maximum system pressure.

**In summary, the C40V is a versatile axial piston pump suitable for a wide range of mobile hydraulic applications where variable flow control and efficient operation are required. The extensive controller options allow for precise tailoring of the pump's behavior to the specific application demands.**
