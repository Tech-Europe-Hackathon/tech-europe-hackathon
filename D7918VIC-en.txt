Here's a summary of the HAWE Hydraulik SE Load-Holding Valve Type CLHV-C, focusing on key features for decision-making:

**Product Overview:**

The CLHV-C is a screw-in type load-holding valve designed to prevent uncontrolled dropping of loads on hydraulic cylinders or motors. It achieves this by being pre-loaded with a pressure setting exceeding the maximum expected load.  A hydraulic piston controls the valve's opening, regulating the lowering speed. Suitable for applications with low to medium oscillation tendencies, especially with proportional directional spool valves (e.g., PSL and PSV types).  It's available with return pressure compensation and spring chamber relief options. It can be installed in manifolds, pipes, or directly on the cylinder/motor.

**Key Features:**

*   **Function:** Prevents uncontrolled load dropping in hydraulic systems.
*   **Type:** Screw-in cartridge valve for flexible installation.
*   **Pressure Rating:** Maximum pressure setting up to 350 bar; maximum load pressure is 320 bar. The pressure setting should be at least 30% higher than the maximum load pressure.
*   **Flow Rate:** Available in 4 sizes, from 4 up to a maximum of 320 lpm (liters per minute) depending on the model.
*   **Sizes and Bore Holes:** Available in various sizes (CLHV 2, 3, 5, 7) each with specific bore hole options (2UNF, 3UNF, T11A, 4UNF, T2A, 6UNF) dictating flow rate and pressure setting.
*   **Control Behaviour:** Offers different geometric control ratios (e.g., 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 8:1, 10:1) affecting response characteristics.
*   **Return Pressure Dependence:** Available in normal (undischarged), return pressure compensated, and discharged (atmospheric) configurations to accommodate various system designs.
*   **Adjustability:** Available with fixed pressure settings or tool-adjustable settings, some with adjustment protection caps.
*   **Seal Material:** Standard HNBR seals, with FKM (FKM) available upon request.
*   **Fluid Compatibility:** Suitable for hydraulic oil (DIN 51 524) and some biologically degradable fluids (HEPG, HEES), with temperature limitations.
*   **Intended Applications:** Well-suited for cranes, construction machines, lifting devices, and agricultural machinery.
*   **Mounting:** Requires specific mounting hole dimensions (detailed in the document) based on the selected bore hole type.
* **Weight:** Dependent on valve type. Ranges from 0.15 kg to 1.0 kg.

**Things to Consider Before Purchase:**

*   **Application Requirements:** Determine the required flow rate, pressure setting, and control behavior for your specific application.
*   **Installation Location:** Decide whether a manifold, in-line, or direct cylinder mounting is needed.
*   **Fluid Type:** Ensure compatibility with your hydraulic fluid.
*   **Adjustability Needs:** Consider whether a fixed or adjustable pressure setting is preferred.
*   **Return Pressure:** If return pressure is a concern consider the option for a return pressure compensated valve.
*   **Related components:** Consider if you need proportional directional spool valves.

This summary should enable you to quickly assess if the CLHV-C series load-holding valve aligns with your system's needs and guide you toward selecting the appropriate model and options.
