Here's a summary of the K61N-DIN fixed displacement axial piston pump, designed for use in open circuits, especially in commercial vehicles with power take-offs:

**Key Features and Benefits:**

*   **Function:** Fixed displacement axial piston pump operating on the bent axis principle, delivering a constant flow rate at a specific rotation speed.
*   **Applications:** Ideal for municipal trucks, fire trucks, loading cranes, elevating work platforms, tipper trucks, skip trucks, suction dredgers, and sewer cleaning vehicles.
*   **Nominal Pressure:** Maximum operating pressure of 400 bar.
*   **Displacement Volume:** Available in sizes ranging from 12.6 cm3/rev to 108.0 cm3/rev (K61N-012 to K61N-108).
*   **Rotation Direction:** Clockwise (R) or Anti-clockwise (L), reversible by turning the connection cover.
*   **Speed:** Max continuous rotation speeds vary by model, up to 2300 min-1 and brief max speeds up to 3000 min-1
*   **Hydraulic Fluid Compatibility:** Compatible with mineral oil-based hydraulic fluids (DIN 51 524 Parts 1-3, ISO VG 10-68) and biodegradable fluids (HEPG, HEES), with temperature limits.
*   **Mounting:** Flange mounting according to ISO 7653.
*   **Ports:** Standard suction, pressure, and drain ports (Pressure connection G 3/4 (nominal size K61N-012…064) & G 1 (nominal size K61N-084…108)).
*   **Material:** Aluminum housing, cast iron connection cover.
*   **Installation:** Suitable for any installation position. Installation below minimum fill level for horizontal installation requires uppermost drain port be used.
*   **Weight:** Varies by model, ranging from 6.9 kg to 13.9 kg.
*   **Accessories:** Suction intakes and bypass valves are available.

**Key Considerations for Suitability:**

*   **Application Requirements:** Check if the required flow rate and pressure align with the pump's specifications.
*   **Fluid Compatibility:** Ensure the selected hydraulic fluid is compatible with the pump's seals and operating temperature range.
*   **Installation Space:** Verify that the pump's dimensions and mounting options fit the available space.
*   **Operating Conditions:** Consider the operating temperature, cleanliness level of the hydraulic fluid, and required inlet pressure.
*   **Drive Torque & Power:** Required drive torque varies with displacement volume.

**Important Notes:**

*   Cleanliness is crucial during assembly and operation.
*   The pump must be filled with hydraulic fluid and bled before use.
*   A system pressure-limiting valve is necessary to prevent exceeding maximum system pressure.
*   Regular inspections for leaks and surface cleaning are recommended for maintenance.
