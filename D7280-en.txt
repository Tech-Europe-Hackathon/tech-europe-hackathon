Here's a summary of the HAWE Hydraulik air-driven hydraulic pump/power pack type LP, designed to help you decide if it suits your needs:

**Core Function:**

*   The LP series is an air-driven hydraulic pump that acts as a pneumatic pressure amplifier.  It uses compressed air to power a reciprocating plunger pump, generating hydraulic pressure. The pump automatically adjusts its flow rate based on air pressure and hydraulic counter-pressure, even coming to a standstill and restarting when pressure changes. It is designed for permanent, short-period and intermittent operation and continuous run with intermittent load (S1, S2, S3, S6).

**Key Features & Benefits:**

*   **High Pressure:**  Achieves hydraulic operating pressures up to 700 bar.
*   **Explosive Environment Suitability:** Can be used in potentially explosive areas (ATEX version available).
*   **Pneumatic Power:** Operated solely with compressed air, eliminating the need for electrical power in hazardous locations.
*   **Start-Stop via Pump:**  The pump automatically starts and stops based on pressure demands.
*   **Versatile Configurations:**
    *   Available as a single pump, a cover plate version for customer-supplied tanks, or a complete hydraulic power pack with integrated tank.
    *   Wide range of tank sizes (B4, B10, B25) offering different fill volumes (7-34 liters)
    *   Available different intake module options based on your tank.
    *   Can be easily integrated with connection blocks and valve banks for customized solutions.
*   **Durable Construction:**  Made with materials like anodized aluminum alloy, electro-galvanized steel, and PTFE seals for wear resistance, temperature resistance and low friction.
*   **PTFE Air-Side Seals:**  Provide low friction, high oil delivery flow, and excellent temperature resistance with low seal wear.

**Key Specifications:**

*   **Maximum Hydraulic Pressure:** 700 bar
*   **Maximum Pneumatic Pressure:** 10 bar
*   **Maximum Geometric Displacement:** 29 cm3/double stroke (Vmax geom.)
*   **Maximum Hydraulic Flow Rate:** 12 l/min (Qmax hydr.)
*   **Maximum Tank Volume:** 34 liters (Vmax tank)
*   **Operating Modes:** S1, S2, S3, S6
*   **Hydraulic Fluid Compatibility:**  Suitable for hydraulic fluids according to DIN 51524 Parts 1-3 (ISO VG 10 to 68), including biologically degradable types (HEPG, HEES).  Viscosity range: 4 – 1100 mm2/s.
*   **Compressed Air Requirements:** Requires clean, dry, and lubricated compressed air prepared by a maintenance unit (filter, water separator, pressure regulator, lubricator).

**Available Options:**

*   **Pump Versions:** Single pump, cover plate, or tank versions.
*   **Intake Modules:** Various intake module depths to suit different tank heights.
*   **Level Switch:** Available with Normally Closed (N/C) or Normally Open (N/O) contacts for low-level indication.
*   **Level Gauge:** Available with different mounting positions.
*   **Geometry:** Options for pressure/suction port locations (rotated by 90°, 180°, or 270°).
*   **Pressure:** Option to pressurize the suction side up to 10 bar (LP 125-10 and LP 160-10 only).
*   **Approvals:** Standard or ATEX (for explosive environments).
*   **Pipe Module:** Options with piping consolidated to one output or individual outputs for self-piping.

**Intended Applications:**

*   Machine Tools
*   Testing and Laboratory Equipment
*   Hydraulic Tools
*   Hydraulic Fixtures
*   Hoisting Equipment

**Things to Consider:**

*   **Air Consumption:**  Check the characteristic lines to estimate air consumption based on your desired hydraulic pressure and flow rate.
*   **Dynamic Pressure:**  Be aware of the dynamic pressure limitations, especially at high flow rates and low hydraulic pressures.
*   **Icing:**  Long running times can lead to icing of the reversing valve and silencer, especially in cold environments. Consider using dried air or antifreeze.
*   **Weight:** Individual weights of the components are documented in the document for your consideration.
*   **Installation:** Vertical for tank/cover plate versions, any orientation for single pumps. Requires correct fittings to withstand pressures.
*   **Connection blocks and valve banks:** For integration to existing hydraulic systems.

This summary should provide a good basis for determining if the HAWE LP series air-driven hydraulic pump/power pack is suitable for your specific application. You should consult the full product documentation for detailed dimensions, performance curves, and installation instructions.
