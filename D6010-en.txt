Here's a summary of the HAWE Hydraulik radial piston pump type R, RG specification, highlighting key features to help determine its suitability for specific needs:

**Overview:**

The HAWE Hydraulik R and RG series are versatile, valve-controlled radial piston pumps designed for use in oil-hydraulic systems, either as motor pumps outside a tank or integrated within a hydraulic power pack. They are capable of supplying hydraulic oil to consumers at high pressure, with a maximum installable capacity of up to 30 kW, depending on size. The RG variant features plain bearings for extended service life in demanding conditions.

**Key Features & Benefits:**

*   **High Pressure Capability:**  Maximum operating pressure up to 700 bar.
*   **Variable Flow Rates:**  Available in a wide range of displacement volumes (0.13 to 64.18 cm3/rev), resulting in flow rates up to 91.2 l/min at 1450 min-1, with some variants operable up to 3600 min-1. See section "2.2 Delivery Flow coding" for a detailed list.
*   **Versatile Applications:** Suitable for high-pressure applications like press construction, fixture design, testing equipment, lubrication systems, and agricultural engineering where a constant flow rate is required.
*   **Design:** Radial piston design with cylinders arranged in one or more layers driven by bearings on the drive shaft.  Pumps are statically and dynamically balanced for smooth operation.
*   **Multiple Configurations:** Available with 1 to 42 cylinders depending on flow requirements. See section "1.2 Assemblies" for a listing of all available configurations.
*   **Bearing Options:**
    *   **Type R:** Roller bearings for standard applications and lower rotation speeds.
    *   **Type RG:** Plain bearings for extended life in harsh conditions and media with low lubricity (e.g., HFC). Not suitable for low rotation speeds.
*   **Fluid Compatibility:**  Designed for hydraulic fluids according to DIN 51524 (ISO VG 10 to 68), including biodegradable options (HEPG and HEES).  Versions are also available for water-based fluids (HFA), with pressure limitations.
*   **Compact Dimensions & High Efficiency:** Efficient design with good function at low viscosity.
*   **Optional Seals:** NBR (standard), FKM (VITON), and EPDM seals available.
*   **Explosion-Proof Version:**  Available with "EX" designation, suitable for hazardous environments (B ATEX compliance to be noted).

**Important Considerations for Suitability:**

*   **Operating Pressure:**  Ensure the selected pump's maximum pressure meets system demands. Consider derating the pressure when using HFA fluids. Also consider the impact of continuous work cycles on bearing life.
*   **Flow Rate:** Select a pump with the appropriate displacement volume and rated speed to achieve the desired flow rate.
*   **Fluid Compatibility:**  Choose a pump with appropriate seals and materials for the hydraulic fluid being used. If using water-based media, the RG variant with HFA is required.
*   **Rotation Speed:**  Optimal performance is around 1450 min-1.  Operating at higher speeds can reduce service life.
*   **Viscosity:**  Maintain hydraulic fluid viscosity within the recommended range (4 - 1500 mm2/s, see the exceptions in section 3.1) for optimal performance and efficiency.
*   **Cleanliness:**  Maintain a high level of hydraulic fluid cleanliness to prevent damage and ensure proper function.
*   **Installation Environment:**  Consider ambient temperature, and potential for overpressure on the suction side.
*   **Power Consumption:** Calculate motor power requirements based on operating pressure and flow rate using the provided formulas.

**In summary, the HAWE R and RG radial piston pumps offer a flexible solution for various high-pressure hydraulic applications. Careful consideration of operating parameters, fluid compatibility, and environmental conditions is essential to select the optimal pump model for a specific application.**
