Here's a summary of the HAWE Hydraulik FXU hydraulic power pack, focusing on key features for decision-making:

**Summary: HAWE Hydraulik FXU Hydraulic Power Pack**

The HAWE Hydraulik FXU is a flexible, modular hydraulic power pack designed for continuous operation with constant load (S1). It's suitable for applications like machine tools, recycling systems, plastics machinery, and pressing operations. Key features include:

**Core Performance:**

*   **Operating Pressure:** Available in High Pressure/Low Pressure (HP/LP) configurations of 700/260 bar.
*   **Geometric Displacement (Vg):** HP/LP options of 64.15/87.5 cm3/rev.
*   **Usable Volume (Vuse max):** Up to 565 liters.
*   **Motor Power:** Maximum motor power of 37 kW.

**Key Features and Options:**

*   **Flexible Configuration:** Modular design allows customer-specific adjustments.
*   **Pump Types:**
    *   **Radial Piston Pumps (R, RG):** For high pressures (up to 700 bar), various sizes available, flow rates from 1.4 l/min to 91.2 l/min.
    *   **External Gear Pumps (Z):** Cost-effective for lower pressures (up to 260 bar), designed for low noise, flow rates from 5.4 l/min to 82.2 l/min.
    *   **Dual-Stage Pumps (RZ):** Combines a radial piston pump (HP) and gear pump (LP) for switching between high and low pressure, offering efficiency for varying load requirements.
*   **Tank Options:**
    *   **Material:** Aluminum or Steel tanks available.
    *   **Volume:** Ranging from 30 liters to 630 liters, with varying usable volumes.
    *   **Accessories:** Feet, oil trays, and drain valves are available as options.
*   **Cooling:**  Oil-water plate heat exchangers can be added to steel tanks for cooling, with water flow rate ideally half the oil flow rate.
*   **Filtration:**
    *   **Return Line Filters:** Filter returning oil flow, various filter fineness (6 μm, 10 μm, 25 μm) options.  A bypass valve ensures operation continues if the filter is clogged, but unfiltered.
    *   **Contamination Indicator:** Visual or electrical/optical clogging indicators available to monitor filter condition.
*   **Monitoring:** Level and temperature switches can be included to signal low oil levels or high temperatures, enabling proactive maintenance. IO-Link option available for advanced monitoring.
*   **Motors:**
    *   **Voltage:** Typically 3x400V 50Hz or 3x460V 60Hz (depending on power), IP55 protection class, IE3 efficiency.
    *   **Options:** Available with or without a motor (customer-supplied motor option).
*   **Valve Mounting:**  Designed for direct mounting of HAWE valve banks (seated and spool valves), including proportional directional spool valves (PSL 3). Pipe connectors and connection blocks are available for valve integration.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Continuous Operation:** Designed for continuous operation with constant load (S1).
*   **Hydraulic Fluid:** Compatible with hydraulic fluids according to DIN 51 524 Parts 1 to 3; ISO VG 10 to 68.  Suitable for biologically degradable fluids (HEES) up to +70°C.
*   **Tank Sizing:**  Tank volume should be chosen based on the duty cycle (continuous or intermittent) and flow rate for optimal heat dissipation.
*   **Filtration:** Choose filter fineness based on the type of valves used in the system (e.g., finer filtration for proportional/servo valves).
*   **Installation:** Vertical installation position required.

This summary should provide enough information to assess if the HAWE Hydraulik FXU is suitable for a given application. Further details on dimensions, weight, and specific valve mounting configurations can be found in the full product documentation.
