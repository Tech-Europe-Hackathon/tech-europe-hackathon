Here's a summary of the HAWE C40V variable displacement axial piston pump, focusing on key features to help you determine if it suits your needs:

**Overview:**

The HAWE C40V is a variable displacement axial piston pump designed for open circuits in mobile hydraulic applications. It uses a swash plate principle to adjust the geometric output volume, thereby controlling the flow rate delivered to hydraulic consumers. It offers a good power-to-weight ratio and a compact design.

**Key Features & Specifications:**

*   **Adjustable Flow:** Variable displacement allows for adjusting the flow rate from maximum to zero.
*   **Pressure Ratings:**
    *   Nominal pressure (pnom max): 280 bar
    *   Peak pressure (pmax): 320 bar
*   **Displacement Volumes:** Available in four sizes:
    *   C40V-028: 28.7 cm³/rev
    *   C40V-045: 46.5 cm³/rev
    *   C40V-085: 86.1 cm³/rev
    *   C40V-100: 103.5 cm³/rev
*   **Controllers:** Offers a variety of controllers to suit different applications:
    *   **Load-Sensing (LS0DA/LS2DA, LS0DE../LS2DE..):**  Maintains a constant pressure differential between load and pump pressure, providing flow on demand.  "DA" versions are for valves that relieve the LS signal, while "DE" versions use electro-proportional pressure limitation, ideal for applications like fan control.  LS2 versions have additional LS relief.
    *   **Pressure Controllers (DF-DA, DE..):** Limits maximum pressure. DF-DA is mechanically adjustable with a remote-control port. DE controllers are electro-proportional, offering rising or falling characteristic lines.
    *   **Flow Controller (VE..):** Electro-proportional control of flow rate, dependent on speed and electrical input, typically used with a pressure controller.
    *   **Power Controller (LR):** Limits the product of pressure and displacement to prevent overloading the drive.
*   **Thru-Shaft Compatibility:** Can be configured with a thru-shaft for driving auxiliary pumps or other components.
*   **Rotation Direction:** Available in clockwise (R) and counter-clockwise (L) versions.
*   **Flange & Shaft Options:** Offers different flange versions (SAE B, C) and shaft journals (splined) to match various drive interfaces.
*   **Housing Versions:** Radial or axial suction and pressure connections.
*   **Hydraulic Fluid Compatibility:** Compatible with mineral oil-based hydraulic fluids (ISO VG 10 to 68). Suitable for biodegradable fluids (HEPG, HEES) up to +70°C.
*   **Operating Temperatures:** Ambient: -40 to +60 °C, Hydraulic Fluid: -25 to +80 °C.
*   **Filtration:** Requires a cleanliness level of ISO 4406 19/17/14.
*   **Installation:** Can be installed in any position, though specific considerations apply to vertical mounting.

**To Decide if this Pump is Right for You:**

1.  **Flow and Pressure Requirements:**  Does the pump's displacement volume and pressure rating (280 bar nominal, 320 bar peak) meet your system's demands?
2.  **Control Strategy:** Which controller type (Load-Sensing, Pressure, Flow, Power) best fits your application's control needs? Consider whether you need flow-on-demand, pressure limitation, or power limiting.
3.  **Drive Interface:**  Ensure the flange and shaft options are compatible with your drive motor or engine.
4.  **Fluid Compatibility:** Verify compatibility with your chosen hydraulic fluid, especially if using biodegradable options.
5.  **Operating Environment:**  Confirm that the pump's temperature range and filtration requirements align with your operating conditions.
6.  **Thru-Shaft Need:** Determine if a thru-shaft is necessary to drive other components.
